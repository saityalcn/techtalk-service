The algorithm works by exploring all possible paths from the starting node to the ending node and selecting the path with the lowest cost. There are several algorithms for finding the shortest path, including Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is the most popular and efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph."
